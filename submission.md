**Commit Message:**


**Files Changed (summary):**
- `Headlight Detection/headlightDetection.py` – 261 lines modified (major refactor)
- `Helmet Detection/main.py` – 63 lines modified (logic update for helmet detection)
- Added new output files (`helmet_bbox.png`, `motorcycle_helmet.jpg`, etc.)

**Annotation:**
This commit represents my most important contribution to the repository. It refactored the existing headlight detection code into a helmet detection system, fixing core logic and ensuring the program could successfully detect helmets in images. In addition, I added supporting images (including a sample helmet picture) and generated outputs that demonstrated the feature working in practice. Compared to smaller fixes or cosmetic changes in other commits, this commit was central to solving the open issue by delivering the primary requested functionality.
